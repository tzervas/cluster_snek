## Branch Management Rules
1. All feature work must be done in feature branches
2. Feature branches must be named according to priority level
3. Branches must be merged in order (Priority 1 before Priority 2, etc.)
4. Each branch should have its own set of tests
5. All tests must pass before merging
6. Code review required for all merges

## Notes
- Items marked with [x] are completed
- Items marked with [ ] are pending
- Priority levels may be adjusted based on project needs
- New items may be added as requirements evolve
