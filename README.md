# Cluster-Snek

Cluster-Snek is a professional-grade tool designed to automate Kubernetes GitOps workflows. Built with Python, it supports multiple deployment modes to suit various environments, from internet-connected setups to fully airgapped systems. This README provides an overview of the project, its features, and how to get started.

## Features

- **Multiple Deployment Modes**: Supports `internet`, `airgapped-vc`, `airgapped-local`, `airgapped-network`, and `airgapped-archive` modes to accommodate diverse operational needs.
- **Configuration Management**: Loads environment variables, user settings, and project structures from YAML or JSON files.
- **Project Structure Generation**: Automatically generates project structures based on provided configurations.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Includes a robust test suite to ensure reliability and correctness.

## Installation

To set up Cluster-Snek, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/cluster-snek.git
   cd cluster-snek
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run Tests**:

   ```sh
   pytest
   ```

## Usage

Cluster-Snek simplifies Kubernetes cluster management through GitOps. Here's how to use it:

1. **Define Project Structure**: Create a YAML or JSON file, e.g., `project_structure.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   src:
     main.py: "Main entry point"
     utils.py: "Utility functions"
   tests:
     test_main.py: "Tests for main"
   README.md: "# Project Title"
   ```

2. **Generate Project Structure**:

   ```sh
   python cluster_snek.py /path/to/target/directory
   ```

3. **Load User Settings**: Use a `.env` file or environment variables:

   ```
   PROJECT_NAME=my-project
   DEPLOYMENT_MODE=internet
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:

   ```sh
   python cluster_snek.py
   ```

## Testing

Run the included test suite to verify functionality:

```sh
pytest
```

Tests cover environment variable loading, user settings, project structure parsing, and deployment mode handling.
